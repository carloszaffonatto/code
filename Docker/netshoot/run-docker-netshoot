Container's Network Namespace: If you're having networking issues with your application's container, you can launch netshoot with that container's network namespace like this:

$ docker run -it --net container:<container_name> nicolaka/netshoot

Host's Network Namespace: If you think the networking issue is on the host itself, you can launch netshoot with that host's network namespace:

$ docker run -it --net host nicolaka/netshoot

Network's Network Namespace: If you want to troubleshoot a Docker network, you can enter the network's namespace using nsenter. This is explained in the nsenter section below.



# docker run --name netshoot --rm -it <network bridge> nicolaka/netshoot /bin/bash
bash-# ip a

# docker run --name netshoot --rm -it --network containers nicolaka/netshoot /bin/bash
bash-# ip a
